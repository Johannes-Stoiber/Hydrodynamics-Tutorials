# Description
Most experiments consist of at least three files:

- setup\_\*.py: This file creates the initial condition file that was used for the experiment.
- plot\_\*.py: This file creates .png files from the output of the simulation.
- \*.gif: This is a .gif file made from the .png files, that the above code produces. It shows the evolution of the simulation.
